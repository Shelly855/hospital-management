# Hospital Management System
**Project Duration:** Jan 26th - Apr 10th 2024

This project, developed as part of a 1st Year university assignment, is a web-based hospital management system that allows hospital staff to manage patients, staff, and medicine supplies efficiently. There are four types of users:

- **Receptionist/Admin**: Manage patient profiles & staff records.  
- **Doctor**: View patient’s basic details & lab test results, edit patient diagnosis details, add issued prescriptions, & add requested lab tests.  
- **Lab Technician**: Manage lab test results in patient’s lab test record.  
- **Pharmacist**: Add the date collected in a prescription record, & edit medicine supply records.

## Technology Used:  
- HTML, JavaScript, PHP

## Database:
- MySQL

## Possible Improvements
- Adding code comments
- Implementing confirmation pages after completing an action
- Creating user-specific dashboards
- Automatic creation of IDs when creating records
- Using names rather than IDs when referring to records from different tables

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository (e.g., in Visual Studio Code) and save it in the **htdocs** directory inside your **XAMPP** folder
2. Open **XAMPP** and start both the **Apache** and **MySQL** servers
3. Open a browser and go to: localhost/hospital-management/login/login.php
